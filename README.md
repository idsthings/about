My learning journey is mainly documented using a system known as Git. Git is designed to track changes across repositories of ocde, even with complex release and integration cycles. Given that my code is probably the best demonstration of what I’m learning, as often I’ll learn new knowledge as I code. I have created a profile on a Git & code hosting platform called GitHub with “forks” of code that I counted towards IDS. If you click on these repositories and then click on the “commits” tab, you will be able to see how I have learned and adapted over time.

My profile is at [github.com/idsthings](https://github.com/idsthings)

Here is where to click once you are a viewing a repository:
